#=====================================================================================================# RFlib : Randomized Forest Library# Date : February 2010# Author : Olivier Teboul# contact : olivier.teboul@ecp.fr# # brief : Provide a multi-class supervised classifier of feature vectors based on randomized forests.#=====================================================================================================1) Code: The code provide a library and an executable example. The executable simply shows how to use Randomized Forest.To run it :>> run_patch.exe imagename label_image_nameTwo images are given in the examples.To compile the code yourself, I strongly recommand the use of CMake.The binaries were compiled with Visual Studio 2008, using for the executable OpenCV 1.20.2) ExtensionsThe code let the possibility to add your own kind of feature vectors, whatever the dimensions or types. For that matter, you only have to write your own class, deriving from IFeatureVector, and implement the operator[] and the method size().The Patch class gives an example of how to write such a derived class.3) Dependencies- RFlib does not need dependencies to compile (other than STL)- The run_patch executable gives an example of how to use RFlib. For that matter, it implements a Patch class that derivesfrom IFeatureVector. This specific class uses OpenCV. If you want to run the example, OpenCV is required.For more information about the code itself, see the doxygen generated documentation, and for even moreplease send me an email : olivier.teboul@ecp.fr3) ReferencesFor more information about these RF classsifiers check references : [1] L.
